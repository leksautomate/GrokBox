PLEASE USE THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS FOR THE "DATA USAGE" / PRIVACY PRACTICES TAB:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Personally identifiable information: NO
2. Health information: NO
3. Financial and payment information: NO
4. Authentication information: NO
5. Personal communications: NO
6. Location: NO
7. Web history: NO
8. User activity: NO
9. Website content: YES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Justification for "Website content":
"The extension accesses web page content (specifically HTML5 video elements and their source URLs) to provide its core functionality: allowing users to download videos from the page. This data is processed locally within the user's browser to generate the download list and file names. No website content is transmitted to any external servers or third parties."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(If asked about "Collection"):
Since the data stays local, you might be able to leave it unchecked if the form definition of "Collect" explicitly excludes local-only data. However, usually with Host Permissions, declaring "Website content" is recommended for transparency because you *are* programmatically accessing the content of the page.
Selecting "Website content" -> "No, I do not use this data for..." (tracking/ads/etc) is the standard safe approach.
